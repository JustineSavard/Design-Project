        <p class="paragraph">
            The Renaissance era was a period of change where artists rediscovered the ideas and concepts of Ancient Rome and Greece. As the idea of individualism and other new philosophies became more popular, art focused on the individuality of man and society. Art began to change in style when the ideas of religion and humanism collided.
            <br>As the concepts of the ancient masters emerged, the techniques in art improved drastically. Perspective was a technique that artists gained a much better understanding of. That, alongside a deeper understanding of depth, created incredibly realistic and detailed paintings that weren’t achievable in the past.
            <br>Another reason paintings were so realistic is the masters’ newfound fascination with the human. Advances in science and human anatomy made it possible for artists to copy every muscle of the body into their paintings and sculptures. This is a very stark difference from the Medieval era, when subjects often looked cartoonish.

        <h3 class="subtitles">MATERIALS</h3>
        <p class="paragraph">
            The Renaissance period saw the adoption of oil paints, paints in which the base was linseed or walnut oil instead of egg like the previous centuries. Though oil paint was invented as early as the 7th century, this medium wasn’t commonly used until the beginning of the 15th century when Jan Van Eyck introduced it to Europe and spread its use. 
            <br>Renaissance artists also used natural chalks made from minerals to draw. This practice, though popularized by the masters in the 16th century, comes from the Stone Age.
