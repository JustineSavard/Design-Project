        <p class="paragraph">
            The art in the medieval period mirrored the economic and cultural situation in Europe during this age. In 476 A.D., the fall of the Roman Empire marks a new era in history, and the art during the following centuries echo the darkness the people in Europe were living through. Early medieval art features dark, grotesque and often bizarre scenes, a reflection of the strife in the world. 
            <br>During the medieval period, most of the art produced was religious, centered around the Church and God. In fact, most pieces in the medieval era had Jesus Christ or God as one of the subjects. In the centuries that followed, artâ€™s purpose was to enlighten and to appeal to religion, and not to express oneself creatively. 
            <br>Towards the later medieval period, architecture became more detailed and sophisticated; the Gothic architecture style emerged. Gothic buildings favoured height, detail, stained glass windows and the inclusion of light. This style would be an introduction to the Renaissance era.

        <h3 class="subtitles">MATERIALS</h3>
        <p class="paragraph">
            Medieval art has a wide range of medias, but across all of them, the use of precious or valuable materials is constant practice. Many artworks include gold, as seen in churches, jewelry and manuscripts, as well as jewels and expensive pigments. In paintings, natural mineral pigments were still used.
