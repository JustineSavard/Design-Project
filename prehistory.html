        <p class="paragraph">
            The true birthplace of art began here. The Paleolithic era was the first time humans started to make things that werenâ€™t for survival or subsistence. Humans started to build things for self-expression. Art in the Paleolithic era mainly consisted of small sculptures and large carvings or paintings on walls. 
            <br>Sculptures were simple and mostly depicted humans or animals. One distinct subject that was particularly common was Venus, a sculpture of an exaggerated depiction of a woman thought to represent fertility. 
            <br>The second, and most well-known form of art in the Paleolithic era were the large paintings or engravings typically found in caves or shelters. Cave paintings are very commonly drawings of animals, geometric figures and traced human hands. The meaning of cave art is still disputed, but most researchers agree that Paleolithic art serves a symbolic or religious function.

        <h3 class="subtitles">MATERIALS</h3>
        <p class="paragraph">
            The sculptures of the Paleolithic era are made of bone, clay, ivory or stone. 
            <br>In paintings, the artists used a vast collection of stones and minerals to create pigments. The color red, for example, could be made with haematite or baked limonite. The color black was often made from charcoal or soot. The pigment would then be mixed with animal fat to create the first version of paint in history.
