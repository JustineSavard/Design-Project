        <h3 class="subtitles">CHARACTERISTICS</h3>      
        <p class="paragraph">
            Art Nouveau was a response to the industrialisation that was happening in Europe for the past century. The rise in mass production and big machines meant craftsmanship and handmade objects were getting wiped out. At the end of the 19th century and at the beginning of the 20th, artists sought to fight the disappearance of artisans and made art with delicate, handmade features. Instead of just paintings, Art Nouveau could be seen in jewelry, furniture, architecture, and other everyday objects, since the goal of Art Nouveau was to bring beauty to everyday life. 
            <br>Art Nouveau focused on the natural world in its art. Many pieces made in the period include things such as leaves, flowers, vines and other natural elements. 
            <br>In architecture, buildings no longer used strong, straight lines and instead adopted longer, more curved and organic edges and lines, giving buildings an ethereal and fairy-like look. 
            <br>Most Art Nouveau pieces use earth toned colour palettes, borrowing again from the common nature theme that Art Nouveau artists try to capture. Designers would use greens and browns as well as rich yellows, indigos, and dark reds and violets, meant to reflect the colours of jewels and minerals.

        <h3 class="subtitles">MATERIALS</h3>
        <p class="paragraph">
            The Industrial Revolution made available a wide range of  materials. Art Nouveau used many of those materials, such as iron, glass, concrete, ceramics and wood in architecture, sculpting and jewelry-making. These materials made it possible to create the flowing, organic shapes that characterize Art Nouveau. 
            <br>The palette of Art Nouveau artists didnâ€™t change much, and artists continued to use the same paints available since the mid 19th century.
